# Engineering Challenges

> FOR MY COLLEAGUES AT MICROSOFT

This repository contains a collection of engineering challenges that I think are interesting and useful for practicing system design. Each challenge will provide requirements for a small component of a larger system. The goal is to design a solution that meets the requirements and explain your work.

Once you do, you can submit to me for review. I will provide feedback on your design and we can discuss. There are few completely right or wrong answers, so it is generally a discussion of trade-offs. Every design will have strengths and weaknesses.

As we are Microsoft engineers, where appropriate assume these are cloud-based solutions deployed in Azure.
